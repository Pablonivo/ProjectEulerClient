    The mathematical problems on the solutions page are taken from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
        href="https://projecteuler.net/about" style="white-space: nowrap;">Project Euler</a>.
    Click on a problem id to see the detailed explanation. Click on compute to let the solution be computed in
    real-time.
    Note that the first computation you do could take about 10 seconds, because the server is sleeping if it has not
    done anything in the past 30 minutes.
